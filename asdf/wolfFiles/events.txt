Room 5
You awake in a dungeon with nothing but rags on your cold, numb body. How
cliché. What's not cliche is the fact that the ground beneath you is actually
quite warm. You're shackled to what appears to be a metal stake with a rather
short chain. It's too dark to see much around you. 

What will you do? Obvious choices are remove stake, break chain, walk
somewhere, or stay here.

- [Remove stake] - You were wrong. The "metal stake" was actually a piece of
balsa wood with a coat of silver paint over it. It was still wet. Your hands
are stained with the essence of second place, but you're free to roam.
(Go to Room 2)
- [Break chain] - You fail to break the chain. What? Did you think the thing was made of balsa wood or something? Don't be ridiculous. Every captor at least
invests in a chain.
(Remain here)
- [Walk north/south/east/west] - You attempt to walk to the limits of the chain and stake. You accidentally walk too far and break the "metal stake" that was
actually a piece of balsa wood with a coat of silver paint over it. I guess
getting ahead of yourself has paid off.
(Go to Room 2)
- [Stay here/chained/attached/forever/until you die] - Congratulations! Your
patience has rewarded you with death. Turns out, nobody bothers to feed anyone
down here in the dungeon. Go figure.
