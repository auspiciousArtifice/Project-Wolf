Room 5.1
You awake in a dungeon with nothing but rags on your cold, numb body. How
cliché. What's not cliché is the fact that the ground beneath you is actually
quite warm. You're shackled to what appears to be a metal stake with a rather
short chain. (s)It's too dark to see much around you... (/s) (pause 2)
#top kek

What will you do? Obvious choices are remove stake, break chain, walk
somewhere, or stay here.

- [Remove stake] -
%r5.1.1
You were wrong. The "metal stake" was actually a piece of
balsa wood with a coat of silver paint over it. It was still wet. Your hands
are stained with the essence of second place, but you're free to roam.
%r5.1.1 -> %r5.2
(Go to Room 5.2)

- [Break chain] -
%r5.1.2
You fail to break the chain. What? Did you think the thing was made of balsa wood or something? Don't be ridiculous. Every captor at least
invests in a chain.
%r5.1.2 -> %c5
(Remain here)

- [Walk north/south/east/west] - 
%r5.1.3
You attempt to walk to the limits of the chain and stake. You accidentally walk too far and break the "metal stake" that was
actually a piece of balsa wood with a coat of silver paint over it. I guess getting ahead of yourself has paid off.
%r5.1.3 -> %r5.2
(Go to Room 5.2)

- [Stay here/chained/attached/forever/until you die] - 
%gameover
Congratulations! Your patience has rewarded you with death. 
Turns out, nobody bothers to feed anyone
down here in the dungeon. Go figure.

Room 1: 
Something about this corner makes you feel like a journeyman, a tyro, a neophyte. 
You honestly don’t care, but you’re not going to get anywhere staring at this corner. 
If you keep this up, you might as well be labeled as a newbie since you haven’t done anything memorable.

A wooden door is bolted shut just to the north. Now would be a good time to have 
more than (stat ROB) robustness. If you know what that is in the first place.

Here is said pile of bones. Something tells you not to sift around in the pile.

Well aren’t you a rebel? A bone pokes through your stomach as soon as you dive into the bone pile, successfully impaling you.

The armor needs refining, but it is more protection from the elements and from monsters. (Get LeatherArmour)

You take the adventurer’s gear and go on about your business. (Get CopperSword and LeatherArmour)

Room 8: Ah, the south side. Ordinarily a disheveled mess, it seems rather clean. In any case, it’s so clean, you can take a good look

%a2
Area 2: Forest Maze (by definition a new area, but it’s really just a bunch of randomly generated rooms with an exit path that can be accessed anywhere)
%a2 -> %rSomethingThatHasn'tBeenTakenYet

Random generation formula: Math.random() * 15
Total of 15 different RNG rooms and one constant room, counter for how many rooms one has accessed, every 17th room results in the final non-random room containing a rest area and the exit path code (if checked).
Stack containing direction chosen for past 10 rooms. If matched with the “EXITCODESTACK,” exit to Area 3. 

RNGROOM 1: There certainly isn’t a lack of greenery here. Trees surround the clearing you stand in, and there doesn’t seem to be anything but shadows filling up the horizon. 

RNGROOM 2: You hear wolves howl in the distance. You think of being adopted by them and subsequently mooching off of their work. Nah. 

RNGROOM 3: Whilst examining your surroundings, a shadow moves in front of you. Suspicious, but you think you know better. You think…

RNGROOM 4: There is a flower in the middle of a plain spot in the ground. You try to pick it up, but it seems to be rooted tightly to the ground. How disheartening. 

RNGROOM 5: You think that you might have enjoyed walks in a forest at one point in your life. Not anymore, however. Not anymore.

RNGROOM 6: Shadows envelop your body, doing absolutely nothing physically but making you feel a bit uneasy. 

RNGROOM 7: A fox brushes past, but promptly gets eaten by a large bird. How unnerving. 

RNGROOM 8: You ponder the mysteries of life. But then realize you’re not sure if you’re even living at this very moment. How curious. 

RNGROOM 9: Qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. What was that? You’re not even sure yourself. It’s as if a lazy playwright just ran out of things to type. You feel like you should just stop this train of thought.

RNGROOM 10: You spot a babbling brook nearby and take a drink. You stub your toe on a stone on your way back. Ouch. 

RNGROOM 11: There is a chest in a clearing. Seems a bit too convenient, but loot is still loot. (Opening the chest results in the ShoddyMimic fight)

RNGROOM 12: You think to yourself that entering this forest was so simple, but exiting is such a chore. Even though following the path turns will probably lead to a way out, you think that it would take the rest of your life.

RNGROOM 13: This place feels unlucky. You don’t really know why, though. It’s just a feeling you’ve got. 

RNGROOM 14: You hum a tune. It was a good tune. You feel proud about yourself. 

RNGROOM 15: You feel like you’re about to reach the end, but then again, it may be a while. It’s not like you know the place in and out. 

Actual not RNGROOM 16: You come across a hut under an oak tree. The hut itself seems pretty cozy and even has a bed under its protective covering. Even though it seems to be summer time, the tree’s leaves are a bright orange hue. You see an inscription on the far left side of the trunk. You think that taking a rest may be a good idea at this point, seeing as though you’ve been here a while. 

-[Rest] (Regain all of HP) You wake up feeling invigorated. 
-[Check inscription] You check the inscription scrawled on the trunk. They seem to be arrows. They point forward, forward, back, back, left, right, left, right, right, back. What? If these are some sort of directions, they don’t make sense to you. Below the arrows there are a few words, “Perspective is key.” Great, more convoluted nonsense.
