Room 1: You awake in a dungeon with nothing but rags on your cold, numb body. How cliché. You’re shackled to what appears to be a metal stake with a rather short chain. It’s too dark to see much around you. 

What will you do?

- [Remove stake] – You were wrong. The “metal stake” was actually a piece of balsa wood with a coat of silver paint over it. It was still wet. Your hands are stained with the essence of second place, but you’re free to roam.  (Go to Room 2)
- [Break chain] – You fail to break the chain. What? Did you think the thing was made of balsa wood or something? Don’t be ridiculous. Every captor at least invests in a chain. (Remain here)
- [Walk north/south/east/west] – You attempt to walk to the limits of the chain and stake. You accidentally walk too far and break the “metal stake” that was actually a piece of balsa wood with a coat of silver paint over it. I guess getting ahead of yourself has paid off. (Go to Room 2)
- [Stay here/chained/attached/forever/until [you/I] die] – Congratulations! Your patience has rewarded you with death. Turns out, nobody bothers to feed anyone down here in the dungeon. Go figure. (You Lose)

Room 2: Somehow your recklessness actually got you somewhere. How protagonistic of you. It’s still too dark to see more than five feet in any direction. Where will you go?

- [Go north] – You go north and find that there is a locked wooden door with some unnerving fungus growing on it. There are stone walls surrounding it. (Go to 3)
- [Go south] – You come face to face with a stone wall with some moss growing on it. How riveting. (Go to 4)
- [Go west] – It appears you weren’t the first one here. There is a pile of bones that occupies a great portion of the dungeon. You suspect that maybe this isn’t the best place to be having an extended stay. (Go to 5)
- [Go east] - *Gasp!* What’s this? It’s a stone wall. That’s what this is. It is a dungeon after all. Nothing to get your knickers in a twist in this corner at least.
