Battle System

Turn based battle. Enemies will wait until you are done with your turn and then act. You have the option to either go first or last, and it can only be changed outside of battle. Weapons and armor increase your ROB and FOR in order for survival. There are no random drops from enemies besides money and even then, only logically (no animals dropping money bullshit). Fighting experience (gory details) can be enhanced by specifying where to strike (eyes, heart, stomach, back, etc). Fleeing is not always an option. 

Three options during your turn:
- Strike (attack, hit, hurt, kill, fight, etc.)
- Fortify (defend, stand ground, brace, protect)
- Abscond (flee, escape, run, be a coward, ditch, bounce, etc.)

And also, if the situation calls, you have only two options that lead to varying events. Very contextualized.

UI shows FET and enemies, but not their FET. An enemy’s FET is estimated through observations that appear in the form of flavor text. 

No experience points. Stats are increased through more battle. The more one attacks, the greater their robustness. The more one fortifies, the greater their fortification. Only certain actions will increase creed. Fettle actually decreases gradually with more and more battles. Stopping to get medical attention will increase Fettle again. Other things can have similar effects.

Stats:
- Fettle (FET) – Your current health. If you run out of this, then you die. That means game over.
- Robustness (ROB) – Your physical strength. More of this means harder hits and more environmental options. 
- Fortification (FOR) – Your physical integrity. More of this means being able to take more hits. 
- Creed (CRE) – Your mental integrity. More of this means… well… more… things.
- 
- Wealth (WEA) – The legal tender that can be used in this world. Note that having more of this doesn’t always spell good things.
